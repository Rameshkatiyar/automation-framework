## POM - Page Object Model
- Page Object Model is a design pattern which has become popular in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. 
- A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your AUT.
- According to Page Object Model, we should keep our tests and element locators separately, this will keep code clean and easy to understand and maintain.
